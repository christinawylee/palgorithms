							<td>We suggest matches based on both common interests and Myers-Briggs personality types. As a result, our matches work on paper and in practice.</td>
							<td>We tell you why you were matched with each potential friend. You'll know right away what interests you have in common and why we think you'd get along!</td>
							<td>Our icebreakers are tailored towards you and your matches' similarities, so you can worry less about getting the conversation rolling.</td>

			<h2>ABOUT US</h2>
				<p>We started off as a participant team in BruinLabs, an 8-week entrepreneurship program hosted by UCLA. After winning first place on demo day, we decided to move forward with our idea and turn our algorithm into a reality. We hope we can help students like us feel more connected during (and after!) these trying times.</p>
			<h3>BETA SESSIONS</h3>
				<p>We host beta sessions to polish our matching algorithm and other app features. Our beta testers are paired with fellow volunteers and are assigned customized icebreaker questions to answer together. If you're interested in signing up (and potentially meeting some new friends), please fill out this Google form!</p>
